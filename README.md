# ApiTests

Test project to learn Angular CLI development using the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) fake API.
The application allows navigating through posts (and their comments), users, albums and the corresponding photos.

The styling has been done with [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/).
